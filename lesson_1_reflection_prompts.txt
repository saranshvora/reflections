What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Well sometimes I may fail to commit and then would not be able to get to those changes. 
	It also helps in avoiding too much memory requirement

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows multiple storage in one commit because these files are interconnected to each other.
	Whereas, in other version controls these files are not inter-related

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log helps to check the number of commits. git diff helps in seeing the differences made between two commits.
